Designed and implemented two convolutional neural networks, using the deep learning toolbox in matlab. The data used was the famous Oxford-17 flower dataset with 17 different species of flowers and 80 images per class. 
Using my own CNN developed from scratch, I trained one classification model that achieved a 40% mean classification accuracy (classnet.mat) and a segmentationmodel that achieved a mean accuracy of 87.26% and a weighted IoU score of 77.72%. The segmentation model was only based on the daffodil class.
